Liskov substitution Principle
...............................
As per the LSP, functions that use references to base classes
           must be able to use objects of the derived class without knowing it.
           
In simple words, derived classes must be substitutable for the base class with out altering
any of the desirable properties of the program

what it actually means
......................
Subtype should retain the behaviour of the main type
children should be like their parents for what they inherit
